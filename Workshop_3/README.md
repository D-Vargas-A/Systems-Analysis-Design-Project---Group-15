## Review and Improvement of the System Architecture
The refined architecture embodies robust engineering principles that ensure the **ASUS failure prediction system** is reliable, scalable, maintainable, and secure.  
By adhering to **ISO 9000**, **CMMI**, and **Six Sigma** standards, the design provides a solid foundation for delivering high-quality predictive analytics that meet ASUS business needs while being prepared for future growth and evolution.

## Quality and Risk Analysis
Monitoring and response practices ensure early detection and resolution of issues.  
The combination of **active observability**, **continuous retraining**, **proactive alerts**, and **redundancy strategies** ensures that the failure prediction system remains reliable and aligned with the **systems engineering principles** documented in the workshops.

---

## Project Management Plan
The plan establishes clear **roles**, **responsibilities**, and **workflows** that enable efficient collaboration and accountability.  
The adoption of the **Kanban methodology** provides flexibility while maintaining visibility into project progress.  
The defined **milestones** and **deliverables** create a structured roadmap that guides the team from data preparation through final deployment.

---

## Incremental Improvements
The incremental improvements documented across workshops demonstrate a commitment to **continuous refinement** based on feedback and emerging best practices.  
The architecture has evolved from a **conceptual design** to a **production-ready system** that balances **technical excellence** with **practical constraints**.
