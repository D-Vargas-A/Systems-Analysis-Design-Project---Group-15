## Workshop 4: Computational Simulation & Chaos Theory

This section comprises the implementation of computational simulations to stress-test the system architecture designed in previous workshops, exploring concepts of chaos theory, sensitivity to initial conditions, and non-linear dynamics.

### Simulation Approaches

We implemented two distinct simulation scenarios to analyze system behavior under chaotic conditions:

**1. Data-Driven Simulation (ML Sensitivity)**
* **Objective:** Analyze the robustness of the predictive model (Logistic Regression) against data drift and numerical noise.
* **Key Features:**
    * Implementation of **Chaos Theory** through controlled noise injection ($\epsilon$) into the dataset.
    * **Feedback Loops:** Automated retraining triggers when accuracy drops below a critical threshold.
    * **Files:** `MLSimulation.java`, `DataPrep.java`.

**2. Event-Based Simulation (Cellular Automata)**
* **Objective:** Model the system's operational states and emergent behaviors using a stochastic cellular automaton.
* **Key Features:**
    * Definition of dynamic states: `NORMAL`, `HIGH_LOAD`, `PARTIAL_FAILURE`, `RECOVERY`.
    * **Non-linear Dynamics:** Transition probabilities increase with system entropy (chaos level) over time.
    * **Files:** `EventSimulation.java`.

### Deliverables

The source code and the final report are located in the `Workshop_4_Simulation` folder.
